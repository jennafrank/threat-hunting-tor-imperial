# ⚫ Imperial Threat Event: Unauthorized TOR Browser Installation and Use

> *Scenario Setup — Classified Documentation for Lab Replication*

This document outlines the steps taken to simulate unauthorized TOR browser activity on a monitored endpoint, generating the telemetry used in the main investigation report. This is the "red side" of the exercise — the actions a threat actor (or insider) would take that the Imperial Security Division then hunts.

## Steps the Threat Actor Took to Create Logs and IoCs

1. **Download the TOR browser installer** from the official project site:
   `https://www.torproject.org/download/`

2. **Execute the silent installation** from the Downloads directory:
   ```
   tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe /S
   ```
   > The `/S` flag suppresses all installation prompts — a deliberate evasion technique that completes the installation in the background without visible windows.

3. **Open the TOR browser** from the desktop folder created during installation.

4. **Establish TOR connections** and browse sites through the anonymization network.
   Notable network activity generated:
   - Outbound connection to `176.198.159.33` on port `9001` (TOR relay)
   - Outbound connection to `194.164.169.85` on port `443` (HTTPS via TOR)
   - Local loopback connection to `127.0.0.1` on port `9150` (TOR SOCKS proxy)

5. **Create a file on the desktop** named `tor-shopping-list.txt` and populate it with content (simulating intent documentation).

6. The file artifacts — including the shopping list, browser shortcuts (`Tor-Browser.lnk`), and browser storage databases — remain on the desktop as forensic evidence.
